2148      moritz | time will tell if it might be easier for the user if all  
                 | entries in @.content do a common role
2149      moritz | like in the browser DOM, all nodes support some common
                 | operations
2150      moritz | I can understand the beauty of stuffing in strings, arrays
                 | etc.
2151      moritz | but as a user it most likely means that you have to do type
                 | checks (or given/when based on type) every time you access
                 | it
2154      tadzik | moritz: regarding your previous sentence, so things like
                 | Pod6::Content, Pod6::Text etc?
2157      moritz | tadzik: maybe. Or maybe just Pod6::Block nodes that have
                 | text instead of contents
2157      moritz | hm, sounds more like a separate Pod6::Text node type
2157      tadzik | yeah
2158      tadzik | hmm, now I don't see how it'd be any different from a plain 
                 | Str
2159      moritz | it's only useful if it has some unified behavior together  
                 | with the rest of the nodes
2159      tadzik | yeah, I'm thinking about it
2159      moritz | which is why I don't yet know if it's worth the trouble
2159      moritz | so, just wait and see
2200      tadzik | yeah, time will tell
