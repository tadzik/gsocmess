S26 says:
Formatting codes are themselves a type of block, and most of them may
nest sequences of any other type of block (most often, other formatting
codes). In particular, you can nest comment blocks in the middle of a
formatting code.

Seems that the Perl 5 module Perl6::Pod has the same feeling:

    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    Perl6::Pod::FormattingCode - base class for formatting code
    =cut
    use warnings;
    use strict;
    use Perl6::Pod::Block;
    use base 'Perl6::Pod::Block';

So it says.

That said, it seems like the only thing which _isn't_ a Pod6::Block are
the directives like =use, =config, =encoding etc. A further investigation
will show whether they're really needed to be kept as a Pod nodes at all.
Maybe just a class attribute of a main node will do? Or nothing at all?
