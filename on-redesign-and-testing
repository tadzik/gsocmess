1956 tadzik | so I design all these needed Pod classes, and weeks later while
            | implementing the parser I can clearly see that I was wrong and I
            | need completely different things so I modify stuff deeply. That's
            | fine, isn't it?
1957  masak | guess so.
1957  masak | what is it you thing you'll need to redesign so deeply?
1957  masak | think*
1958 tadzik | well, I don't know now :) I feel a bit like a blind one in a fog
            | right now, "what may I need"
2002  masak | ok, let me scare you and soothe you at the same time :)
2002  masak | it's quite possible that what you describe will happen.
2003  masak | and the better the test coverage, the less of a problem you'll
            | have moving from an old model to one you like better.
2003  masak | so write tests! :)                               
2005  masak | I think I went through five or so redesigns of GGE. but the tests
            | kept me on track. without them, I'd have given up many times
